#
# Tray-less desktops: a hidden (--startup) launch needs a tray host.
#
# Upstream creates the main window with `show:i&&...` where i is false for a
# `--startup` launch (upstream's own XDG autostart entry passes --startup), so
# the window is born hidden and only the tray icon can bring it back. Nothing
# shows it when no tray icon exists: on a Wayland session without an
# org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher (vanilla GNOME without the AppIndicator
# extension, sway/niri without a tray-capable bar), or with the tray switched
# off in settings, an autostart launch is an invisible process.
#
# Closing the main window on a desktop without a tray host is handled by
# upstream itself (its close handler quits when no tray icon is shown).
#
# We inject js/tray_host_probe.js (async NameHasOwner probe, cached, via
# busctl -> dbus-send -> gdbus from PATH) right after upstream registers
# showMainWindow for the new window:
#     ,(<probe>).startup(i,<showMainWindow>,()=><settings>("menuBarEnabled"))
# which, when the window was born hidden and there is no tray to reach it from
# (no watcher on Wayland, or the tray switched off in settings), calls
# upstream's own showMainWindow. With a watcher on the bus, with the probe
# still pending or unable to answer, and on X11 (XEmbed trays are invisible to
# the bus), upstream behavior is unchanged.
#
# The settings reader name is read (not modified) from upstream's close
# handler `if(!<settings>("menuBarEnabled")){...tray is disabled...}`, which
# also pins that all sites sit in the same window-creation function.
#
# Idempotency: the injected startup hook present exactly once, and it is the
# only marker in the input -> already applied (1/1). Any other marker state
# (duplicated hook, a stray marker) -> FAIL.
