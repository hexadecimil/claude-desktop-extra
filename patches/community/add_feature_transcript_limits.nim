# Load large sessions in full - opt-in, off by default.
#
# Upstream's session manager (the `[CCD]` class that logs "transcript is N bytes;
# tail-loading last 52428800 bytes") loads only the LAST 50 MiB of a session's
# transcript, plus ONE shared 32 MiB for all of the session's subagent
# transcripts, and hides the rest behind "Earlier messages aren't shown. This
# session is too large to load in full." / "Some agent activity isn't shown.
# ...". Sessions with many inline browser screenshots reach that within hours
# (a screenshot is ~0.4 MB of base64; the main transcript stores each tool result
# twice, subagent transcripts once, so 60-80 of them reach a limit).
#
# The class already takes an optional `loadLimits` config object, merged over its
# own defaults (`this.limits={...defaults,...loadLimits}`) and also read by
# predictTranscriptTruncation, which decides whether the "too large" notice is
# shown BEFORE the load runs. Nothing in the app ever passes it. This patch does,
# and only when the user opted in; with the switch off the value is undefined and
# every upstream number, including any Anthropic changes in future, stays as
# shipped. That is why this feeds Anthropic's own hook instead of rewriting the
# number literals: one semantic change, no tracking of upstream's values.
#
#   A. inject js/transcript_limits_main.js (pref, derivation, IPC, worker env)
#   B. precondition (asserted, not applied): the generic worker host forks with
#      main's live env - see below
#   P. precondition (asserted, not applied): upstream still READS `loadLimits` -
#      see below
#   C. `new <Manager>({[k:v,...]onTranscriptTruncatedChanged:` ->
#      `new <Manager>({loadLimits:globalThis.__cdbTranscriptLimits?.(),[k:v,...]onTranscriptTruncatedChanged:`
#      at BOTH construction sites (the session manager, and the sidebar's
#      lightweight reader, whose truncation callback is a no-op).
#
# The worker's own copy of the limits object is
# add_feature_transcript_limits_worker.nim (one target per patch file).
#
# PRECONDITION, not a sub-patch: the heavy-work utility process only sees
# CDB_TRANSCRIPT_LIMITS if the generic worker host forks with main's live env
# (utilityProcess.fork() with no `env` hands the child the browser process's
# INITIAL environment). That change is owned by add_feature_files_quick_open.nim
# sub-patch B, which runs first in basename order; carrying a copy here would make
# this patch take an "already" branch on a pristine bundle, and the absorption
# probe blocks that. So it is asserted instead, and the build fails loudly if the
# pass-through is ever missing, e.g. if that patch is dropped. The pinned shape is
#   utilityProcess.fork(r,[],{serviceName:t,stdio:"pipe",env:Object.assign({},process.env)})
#
# PRECONDITION, not a sub-patch: upstream still CONSUMES the option. C's end
# state only proves that WE pass `loadLimits:`. If upstream renamed the option,
# both constructor anchors would still match, C would print [OK], and the
# manager would silently ignore the value. So its two reads are pinned, each to
# exactly one site (2.9939.4 shapes, in an index.chunk-*):
#   this.inProcess=new _e(e.loadLimits)   the in-process reader: the limits are
#                                         merged over the defaults ({...ae,...e})
#   let c=this.config.loadLimits          predictTranscriptTruncation's read
# Neither regex can match our own injection: C writes `loadLimits:globalThis...`
# and js/transcript_limits_main.js must never spell either shape (not even in a
# comment - it is injected verbatim), so an idempotent second run still counts 1.
#
# Break risk: LOW. A has a stable head-of-bundle anchor; the preconditions pin the
# fork site's end state and upstream's two `loadLimits` reads (exactly one each);
# C anchors on a config
# PROPERTY name (`onTranscriptTruncatedChanged:`), which survives minification
# where identifiers do not. C is pinned to exactly two sites: a third (or a
# renamed option) fails the build rather than silently skipping a manager.
